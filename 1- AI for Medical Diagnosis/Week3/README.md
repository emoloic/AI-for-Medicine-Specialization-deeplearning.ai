# Image Segmentation on MRI Images

In this Week 3, we will prepare 3D MRI data, implement an appropriate loss function for image segmentation, and apply a pre-trained U-net model to segment tumor regions in 3D brain MRI images.

## Learning Objectives

- Perform image segmentation on 3D MRI data.
- Take random sub-samples from a 3D image.
- Standardize an input image.
- Apply a pre-trained U-Net model.
- Implement a proper loss function for model training (soft dice loss).
- Evaluate model performance by calculating sensitivity and specificity.
